    "# Technical Test: Python and SQLAlchemy Proficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This test is designed to assess your proficiency in Python programming and your understanding of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using SQLAlchemy. You will interact with a small database application in a Jupyter Notebook environment, showcasing your ability to manage and manipulate data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "The test will be conducted in a Jupyter Notebook hosted on GitHub. All necessary libraries, including SQLAlchemy, are pre-installed, and the environment is set up for you. You will work on a fork of the provided repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You will complete a series of tasks that involve interacting with a small database application using Python and SQLAlchemy. The test will evaluate your ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement ORM Models**: Create Python classes that map to database tables using SQLAlchemy ORM, including fields, relationships, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Perform CRUD Operations**: Write Python code to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database using SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Optimization**: Demonstrate your ability to write efficient queries, utilizing SQLAlchemy features to optimize database access.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Handle Transactions**: Implement transaction management to ensure data integrity during complex operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Documentation and Code Quality**: Provide clear documentation and adhere to best practices in code structure and style.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the provided GitHub repository to your own account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access the Jupyter Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook in your forked repository to begin the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complete the Tasks**: Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete each task. Ensure your code is functional and meets the specified requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use SQLAlchemy Documentation**: Refer to the [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org) as needed to assist with your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you have completed the tasks, commit your changes to your forked repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Submit Your Test**: Notify us by providing a link to your forked repository with your completed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Correctness**: The solution should meet all specified requirements and perform all operations correctly.\n",
    "-  **Code Quality**: Code should be clean, well-organized, and follow Python best practices.\n",
    "-  **Efficiency**: Solutions should be optimized for performance, especially in the context of database operations.\n",
    "-  **Problem Solving**: Demonstrated ability to effectively solve problems and make sound design decisions.\n",
    "-  **Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation that helps reviewers understand your approach and implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We look forward to reviewing your work and assessing your potential to contribute to our development team."
