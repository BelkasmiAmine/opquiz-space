# Technical Test: Python and SQLAlchemy Proficiency

## Objective

This test is designed to assess your proficiency in Python programming and your understanding of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) using SQLAlchemy. You will interact with a small database application in a Jupyter Notebook environment, showcasing your ability to manage and manipulate data effectively.

## Test Environment

The test will be conducted in a Jupyter Notebook hosted on GitHub. All necessary libraries, including SQLAlchemy, are pre-installed, and the environment is set up for you. You will work on a fork of the provided repository.

## Test Overview

You will complete a series of tasks that involve interacting with a small database application using Python and SQLAlchemy. The test will evaluate your ability to:

1. **Implement ORM Models**: Create Python classes that map to database tables using SQLAlchemy ORM, including fields, relationships, and constraints.

2. **Perform CRUD Operations**: Write Python code to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database using SQLAlchemy.

3. **Query Optimization**: Demonstrate your ability to write efficient queries, utilizing SQLAlchemy features to optimize database access.

4. **Handle Transactions**: Implement transaction management to ensure data integrity during complex operations.

5. **Documentation and Code Quality**: Provide clear documentation and adhere to best practices in code structure and style.

## Instructions

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the provided GitHub repository to your own account.

2. **Access the Jupyter Notebook**: Open the Jupyter Notebook in your forked repository to begin the test.

3. **Complete the Tasks**: Follow the instructions in the notebook to complete each task. Ensure your code is functional and meets the specified requirements.

4. **Use SQLAlchemy Documentation**: Refer to the [SQLAlchemy documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org) as needed to assist with your implementation.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you have completed the tasks, commit your changes to your forked repository.

6. **Submit Your Test**: Notify us by providing a link to your forked repository with your completed test.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness**: The solution should meet all specified requirements and perform all operations correctly.
- **Code Quality**: Code should be clean, well-organized, and follow Python best practices.
- **Efficiency**: Solutions should be optimized for performance, especially in the context of database operations.
- **Problem Solving**: Demonstrated ability to effectively solve problems and make sound design decisions.
- **Documentation**: Clear and concise documentation that helps reviewers understand your approach and implementation.

We look forward to reviewing your work and assessing your potential to contribute to our development team.
